# Uptricks-Project-on-Sentiment-Analysis
**Sentiment Analysis on Lakme Products by using Nykaa**
* Here, I utilize the Roberta model and the Vader Lexicon for sentiment analysis to obtain Positive, Neutral, and Negative scores from customers on their reviews. Compare the model's scores after obtaining this outcome.
* Subsequently, I developed a TF-IDF vectorizer and used Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier to achieve accuracy on test data. Here, I found that RandomForestClassifier outperforms Multinomial Naive Bayes in terms of accuracy of result.
